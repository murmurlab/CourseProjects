// Welcome to the 80s and their unbelievable technology! Write a program that behaves
// like a crappy awesome phonebook software.
// You have to implement two classes:
// • PhoneBook
// ◦ It has an array of contacts.
// ◦ It can store a maximum of 8 contacts. If the user tries to add a 9th contact,
// replace the oldest one by the new one.
// ◦ Please note that dynamic allocation is forbidden.
// • Contact
// ◦ Stands for a phonebook contact.
// In your code, the phonebook must be instantiated as an instance of the PhoneBook
// class. Same thing for the contacts. Each one of them must be instantiated as an instance
// of the Contact class. You’re free to design the classes as you like but keep in mind that
// anything that will always be used inside a class is private, and that anything that can be
// used outside a class is public.
